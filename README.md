# acl-service-handbook
Community sourced handbook for how to do various service related duties related to ACL.
This started as an idea to cover workshop organizing, but may be useful for other service too.
The main goal is to put into writing things we've learned in the process of doing these for the first time.


## Installation and Building

This handbook uses [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) which is also used to build the Rust book.
