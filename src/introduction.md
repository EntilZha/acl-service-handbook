# Introduction

This handbook is a community driven effort to provide guidance on how to participate in various forms of service related to the ACL, especially for the first time.
For example, this book will cover the essential components of being a first-time:

- Conference reviewer
- Area chair
- Session Chair
- Workshop Organizer
- Tutorial Organizer

Why create another resource?
The primary goal of this handbook is to collect useful information for ACL service in one place.
While there are many excellent resources already, we want to make it easy to (1) find basic information about how to do each of these and (2) have a community maintained listing of helpful resources for each of these.
For example, we will provide a general overview of reviewing, specifically intended to explain the process to 1st time reviewers, but will defer questions like "how to write a good review" to the many excellent, existing resources.
On the other hand, some information is usually passed adhoc (e.g., how to run a conference session or important steps in organizing a workshop), so we believe having this information easily accessible would be great.

There already is an [ACL conference handbook](https://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Conference_Handbook), which contains a lot of helpful information.
Where possible, our goal is to update this information as well as include direction links to relevant pages.
Ideally, this will improve the discoverability of existing resources, while keeping a handbook format that is geared towards "as a first time X, what do I need to do?"

## Kickstart at NAACL 2022

To kickstart work on this handbook, Pedro Rodriguez and Zeerak Talat will be running a 1-2 hour session starting at 14:00 on Wednesday July 13 (Room TBD).

For this, we would like to gather community members with experience in these roles to help kickstart guides for each of these.
These pages should include basic information such as expectations as well as useful advice.
