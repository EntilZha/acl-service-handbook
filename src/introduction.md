# Introduction

This handbook is a community driven effort to provide guidance on how to participate in various forms of service related to the ACL, especially for the first time.
For example, this book will cover the essential components of being a first-time:

- Conference reviewer
- Area chair
- Session Chair
- Workshop Organizer
- Tutorial Organizer

We hope that this list will grow over time with community contributions, and also serve as a way to collect the excellent guidance that already exists, but that may be hard to find.
